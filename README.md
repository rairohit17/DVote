 # D-Vote Smart Contracts

This repository contains the core smart contracts for the decentralized voting application D-Vote. 

The system is designed to facilitate secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections using blockchain technology.


## Features

Decentralized: Leverages Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparency and security.

Smart Contract Logic: Written in Solidity (version 0.8.26) for robust and secure operations.

## Validation:

Prevents duplicate voter registrations.

Ensures candidates exist before they can receive votes.

Restricts unregistered users from voting.
